1,Hispa,"Brown spots on rice can start on even seedling leaves and are usually small round to oval circles, brownish in color. It is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed. Brown spot is an indicator of unfavorable growing conditions, including insufficient nitrogen, inability of the plants to use nitrogen because of rice water weevil injury, root rot or other unfavorable soil conditions.",./dummy_data/image/hispa.jpg
2,Leaf blast,"Blast is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. It can affect all above ground parts of a rice plant: leaf, collar, node, neck, parts of panicle, and sometimes leaf sheath. From the seedling stage through plant maturity, rice blast progresses through several phases starting with leaf blast, followed by collar, panicle and node blast.Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. A leaf blast infection can kill seedlings or plants up to the tillering stage. At later growth stages, a severe leaf blast infection reduces leaf area for grain fill, reducing grain yield. Leaf blast can kill rice plants at seedling stage and cause yield losses in cases of severe infection.",./dummy_data/image/leafblast.jpg
3,Brown Spot,"Rice hispa scrapes the upper surface of leaf blades leaving only the lower epidermis. It also tunnels through the leaf tissues. When damage is severe, plants become less vigorous. The insect pest is a problem particularly in Bangladesh. Records show that it can infest large areas and causes yield losses of up to 20%. Eggs are found inside the leaf tissue towards the tip of the leaf. On hatching, the young grubs feed between the upper and lower layers of the leaf, tunnelling downwards. The grubs are legless, creamy white and are not easily seen because they are concealed inside the leaf tissues. They are flattened and pale yellow in colour. They pupate inside the leaf mines that they create.
During severe attack, the leaves become white and then die.",./dummy_data/image/brownspot.jpg
